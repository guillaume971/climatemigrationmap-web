# World Migration Map Frontend (worldmigrationmap-web)

World Migration Map Frontend is the client-side component of the World Migration Map application. It’s an open-source project developed by Heitor Nóbrega Tico and Guillaume Lelasseur, which presents an interactive world map interface visualizing historical migration trends.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes migration patterns by adjusting the transparency of each country, where color intensities represent net migration rates.
- **Year Slider**: Users can navigate through years from 1950 to the current year to see the changes in migration patterns over time.
- **Detailed Tooltip**: Hovering over a country provides specific migration rate data for the selected year.
- **Event List**: Displays significant global events influencing migration patterns.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Showcases an article detailing the potential impacts of climate change on future migration patterns when selecting a year beyond the present.

Our goal with this tool is to raise awareness about global migration trends and their correlation with various world events and climatic changes.
